                <h1>Find perfect romantic dining spot</h1>
                <p>
                    This trail is well maintained and flat the majority of the way 
                    so it is suitable for the whole family. There are numerous parks 
                    and lovely waterfalls along the way.  It's a great route in the city to relax, 
                    stretch your legs, digest lunch or dinner, or just get back out 
                    to the peaceful realm of nature. Get that body moving, 
                    the lungs breathing in that beautiful fresh air and feel that connection with nature.

                <h1>More about dining</h1>
                <p>
                    Some say that eating outdoors brings even more pleasure when enjoying selected 
                    food and drinks. Do you agree? In warmer days, there are plenty of places along 
                    Dodder river to eat in the street or while accompanied by the sound of crickets 
                    chirping in the meadow or surrounded by river banks. Add some freshness and romance 
                    by enjoying your lunch or dinner on well-maintained summer gardens and terraces, 
                    or dare to experience something more unusual. For pleasant homely atmosphere, 
                    sit with the locals on courtyards in rural homesteads and enjoy fresh local delicacies.

                <h3>The Dropping Well</h3>
                <p>
                    Overlooking the river Dodder (and an out of context sculpture of a rhino) 
                    in the suburb of Rathmines is the pretty well-renowned Dropping Well. 
                    It's got a pretty gnarly origin story, as it was first licensed as a 
                    community morgue during the famine. Fast-forward a couple of centuries 
                    and The Dropping Well is now a pretty jolly spot that has dispensed with 
                    its cold-storage shtick.
