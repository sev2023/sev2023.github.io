                    The Dodder River is a unique river in that it supports a wide range of natural 
                    and built heritage interests within an urban setting. Linking the Dublin Mountains 
                    with Dublin Bay it provides a home for protected birds and mammals, 
                    for fish and insects, and a location for specialised habitat types.

                <p>
                    The Dodder rises on the northern slopes of Kippure in the Wicklow Mountains 
                    and is formed from several streams. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The headwaters flow from Kippure Ridge, and include, and are often mapped 
                    solely as, Tromanallison, which is then joined by Mareen's Brook, 
                    including the Cataract of the Brown Rowan, and then the combined 
                    flow meeting the Cot and Slade Brooks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dodder is 26 kilometres long. It passes the Dublin suburbs of Tallaght 
                    and then Firhouse, travels by Templeogue, passes Rathfarnham, Rathgar, 
                    Milltown, Clonskeagh, and Donnybrook, and goes through Ballsbridge 
                    and past Sandymount, before entering the Liffey near Ringsend.

                <h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
                <p>
                    Flora along the river is varied. 
                    Bryophytes and algae are common with an abundance of filamentous green algae. 
                    Crocosmia, Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are the only invasive 
                    species recorded along the river.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dodder is home to many water-bird species including mallard, 
                    grey heron, kingfisher, dipper, coot, moorhen, grey wagtail, common sandpiper, 
                    cormorant and mute swan; the sparrowhawk nests in the trees lining the riverbanks. 
                    The red fox is common along the riverbank and the badger and otter have 
                    also been seen. In recent years a small feral population of mandarin ducks has 
                    become established by the river. It was reported in 2013 that an 
                    Irish Wildlife Trust survey found otters living along the Dodder.
