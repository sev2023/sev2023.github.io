                    The Dodder River is a unique river in that it supports a wide range of natural 
                    and built heritage interests within an urban setting. Linking the Dublin Mountains 
                    with Dublin Bay it provides a home for protected birds and mammals, 
                    for fish and insects, and a location for specialised habitat types.

                    The Dodder rises on the northern slopes of Kippure in the Wicklow Mountains 
                    and is formed from several streams. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The headwaters flow from Kippure Ridge, and include, and are often mapped 
                    solely as, Tromanallison, which is then joined by Mareen's Brook, 
                    including the Cataract of the Brown Rowan, and then the combined 
                    flow meeting the Cot and Slade Brooks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dodder is 26 kilometres long. It passes the Dublin suburbs of Tallaght 
                    and then Firhouse, travels by Templeogue, passes Rathfarnham, Rathgar, 
                    Milltown, Clonskeagh, and Donnybrook, and goes through Ballsbridge 
                    and past Sandymount, before entering the Liffey near Ringsend.

                <h3>Flora and fauna</h3>
                <p>
                    Flora along the river is varied. 
                    Bryophytes and algae are common with an abundance of filamentous green algae. 
                    Crocosmia, Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are the only invasive 
                    species recorded along the river.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dodder is home to many water-bird species including mallard, 
                    grey heron, kingfisher, dipper, coot, moorhen, grey wagtail, common sandpiper, 
                    cormorant and mute swan; the sparrowhawk nests in the trees lining the riverbanks. 
                    The red fox is common along the riverbank and the badger and otter have 
                    also been seen. In recent years a small feral population of mandarin ducks has 
                    become established by the river. It was reported in 2013 that an 
                    Irish Wildlife Trust survey found otters living along the Dodder.

                    Dodder Greenway is being developed to be a Greenway of international renown 
                    and to be on a par with the best greenways in the world. 
                    When complete it is envisaged to be over 17km long, linking Sir John Rogerson's 
                    Quay in the City Center to the entrance to the Bohernabreena reservoirs at Glenasmole, 
                    South Dublin. Although developed as a combination of off road and on road it utilises 
                    existing facilities within the Dodder Valley as much as possible to connect the linear 
                    parklands along the route.

                <p>
                    Bushy Park in Terenure, South Dublin was a popular choice when we asked parents 
                    to recommend the best walks for families in Ireland. 
                    It sits alongside the Dodder River and covers over 20 hectares. 
                    A variety of activities take place including tennis, boules, 
                    play areas and a purpose build skatepark open to skateboarders, 
                    BMX bikes and skaters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes it great for an Autumn walk is the Native Tree Trail, with over 
                    15 native tree signposts dotted throughout the park, you can download a booklet 
                    and do a walking trail to find them all.

                <p>
                    The Dodder is a popular river for fishing and angling amongst Dubliners. 
                    The fishing season is open between 17 March and 30 September.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fish present in the river include brown trout, sea trout, stone loach, 
                    three-spined stickleback and European eel. Atlantic salmon can also be found 
                    in the river's lower course. <br/>Atlantic salmon and lamprey eels are expected 
                    to return to most of the river after a more than 200-year absence pending the 
                    construction of fish ladders.

                    Some say that eating outdoors brings even more pleasure when enjoying selected 
                    food and drinks. Do you agree? In warmer days, there are plenty of places along 
                    Dodder river to eat in the street or while accompanied by the sound of crickets 
                    chirping in the meadow or surrounded by river banks. Add some freshness and romance 
                    by enjoying your lunch or dinner on well-maintained summer gardens and terraces, 
                    or dare to experience something more unusual. For pleasant homely atmosphere, 
                    sit with the locals on courtyards in rural homesteads and enjoy fresh local delicacies.

                    in the suburb of Rathmines is the pretty well-renowned Dropping Well. 
                    It's got a pretty gnarly origin story, as it was first licensed as a 
                    community morgue during the famine. Fast-forward a couple of centuries 
                    and The Dropping Well is now a pretty jolly spot that has dispensed with 
                    its cold-storage shtick.
