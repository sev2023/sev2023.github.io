                    This trail is well maintained and flat the majority of the way 
                    so it is suitable for the whole family. There are numerous parks 
                    and lovely waterfalls along the way.  It's a great route in the city to relax, 
                    stretch your legs, digest lunch or dinner, or just get back out 
                    to the peaceful realm of nature. Get that body moving, 
                    the lungs breathing in that beautiful fresh air and feel that connection with nature.

                    Dodder Greenway is being developed to be a Greenway of international renown 
                    and to be on a par with the best greenways in the world. 
                    When complete it is envisaged to be over 17km long, linking Sir John Rogerson's 
                    Quay in the City Center to the entrance to the Bohernabreena reservoirs at Glenasmole, 
                    South Dublin. Although developed as a combination of off road and on road it utilises 
                    existing facilities within the Dodder Valley as much as possible to connect the linear 
                    parklands along the route.

                <h3>Family activity</h3>
                <p>
                    Bushy Park in Terenure, South Dublin was a popular choice when we asked parents 
                    to recommend the best walks for families in Ireland. 
                    It sits alongside the Dodder River and covers over 20 hectares. 
                    A variety of activities take place including tennis, boules, 
                    play areas and a purpose build skatepark open to skateboarders, 
                    BMX bikes and skaters.

                <p>
                    What makes it great for an Autumn walk is the Native Tree Trail, with over 
                    15 native tree signposts dotted throughout the park, you can download a booklet 
                    and do a walking trail to find them all.

                <h3>Fishing and angling</h3>
                <p>
                    The Dodder is a popular river for fishing and angling amongst Dubliners. 
                    The fishing season is open between 17 March and 30 September.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fish present in the river include brown trout, sea trout, stone loach, 
                    three-spined stickleback and European eel. Atlantic salmon can also be found 
                    in the river's lower course. <br/>Atlantic salmon and lamprey eels are expected 
                    to return to most of the river after a more than 200-year absence pending the 
                    construction of fish ladders.
