                    The Dodder River is a unique river in that it supports a wide range of natural 
                    and built heritage interests within an urban setting. Linking the Dublin Mountains 
                    with Dublin Bay it provides a home for protected birds and mammals, 
                    for fish and insects, and a location for specialised habitat types.
